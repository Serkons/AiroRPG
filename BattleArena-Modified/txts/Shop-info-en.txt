Every time you should buy something in the shop are excluded7(Items and weapons as well as styles, limit breaks)
So the price will increase this is determined by the shop level. So every time you update your weapon or
If you increase the character values, the price increases slightly.
This means that if you buy the value Str for the 1st time and your shop level is level 1.0, it will cost a little more for the 2nd purchase.
So if we now want to increase character values such as HP STR DEF INT SPD IG, how do we proceed:
1. We need the price list of the values we want to increase, so we write 7!ishop list stats
2. If we now want to have +50 more HP permanently, we write 7!ishop buy stats HP.
3. If everything went well, the credit will be deducted and the shop level increased
4. We can also write a number after the following command: 7!ishop buy stats HP 5
This means that we permanently bought 250 life points.
5. We can do the same with the other values, you can decide here.
But always remember to monitor your balance.
Next I want to tell you something about the weapons and techniques
So write 7!tut-en-w-t
