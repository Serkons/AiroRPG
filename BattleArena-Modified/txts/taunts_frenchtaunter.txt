You don't frighten me, English pig dog!
I blow my nose at you, %enemy $+ !
I don't want to talk with you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough wiper! I fart in your general direction!
Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries!
You don't frighten me with your silly knees-bent running around advancing behavior!
Now go away, or I shall taunt you a second time!
NI!
