I'm taking over this battlefield. Don't try to fight it!
Don't get in my way!
I'm starting to get bored with all of this winning.
Oh? Sorry, I didn't see you there. You must not have been important enough for me to notice.
Impressed? You should be!
Come on, then. Show me what you've got!
Never underestimate the power of a full-fledged princess of Twilight!
Now that you understand what sort of power I'm working with, hurry up and surrender.
You think you'll defeat me? Oh my, that's rich.
That's all? If I'd known it'd be this easy, I wouldn't have even bothered to show up!
