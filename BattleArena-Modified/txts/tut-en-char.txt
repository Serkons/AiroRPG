The character here is a virtual nickname that you need to play here.
Note that the upcoming messages can only reach you if your main nick is registered with NickServ.
If you haven't already done so, follow this guide: https://game-igame--rpg-de.translate.goog/docu/index.php?title=Start-_und_Charakterbefehle&_x_tr_sl=de&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=de&_x_tr_pto=wapp
To create your character now, only one command is needed. Everything else will be explained to you later. So write now 4(7!create char4), to register your account at AiroRPG.
You will now be contacted privately with some data, please note the password there.
After that you can jump to the next step, the password change.
That's why you write 4(7!tut-en-pass4)
